# AI Snake Game

This is an implementation of the classic Snake game with an artificial intelligence agent that learns to play the game.

# Features:
- The AI agent uses a Q-learning algorithm to learn and improve its gameplay over time.
- The game environment includes obstacles and rewards to challenge the AI agent.
- Performance metrics such as score and record are displayed during gameplay.
- A plotting function is available to visualize the scores and mean scores over time.

Dependencies:
- PyTorch: Deep learning framework used for implementing the Q-learning algorithm.
- NumPy: Library for numerical computations, used for array operations.
- Pygame: Library for creating games and multimedia applications, used for the game interface.
